This set of initial labs will get you to page 15 in the Juniper Segment Routing Day One book.

Also included is a EVE-NG lab export of this initial setup (no CE configs - but they appear in the topology).

The syslog filtering is used to remove some annoying messages from the virtual console connections used by EVE-NG when you don't have a mgmt. connection.

The IPv6 ISIS adjacencies are created using the automatic link local addressing - so no need to address them individually.
